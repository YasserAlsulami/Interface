Overview
This project is a simple Login Interface implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It provides a user-friendly interface for users to log into a clinic's system. The design is clean and responsive, ensuring a pleasant user experience across different devices.
Features
Responsive Design: The layout adjusts to fit various screen sizes, making it accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
User-Friendly Interface: The form includes clear labels and placeholders, guiding users to enter their credentials easily.
Input Validation: The form requires users to fill in both the username and password fields before submission.
Login Functionality: A simple JavaScript function checks the entered credentials against predefined values (username: "admin", password: "1234"). If the credentials are correct, a success message is displayed; otherwise, an error message is shown.
Interactive Elements: The interface includes links for "Forgot Password?" and "Create Account," enhancing user engagement.
Visual Appeal: The use of CSS for styling provides a modern look with rounded corners, shadows, and hover effects on buttons and links.
Image Integration: An image representing the clinic is included at the top of the login form, adding a personal touch to the interface.
This login interface serves as a foundational component for any web application requiring user authentication, and it can be easily expanded with additional features such as backend integration for real user authentication.
